# AI Applications in Medical Imaging

## Auto-Segmentation and Labeling

- **Automated Segmentation**: Utilize Med-ImageNet data to train models that
  can perform automatic segmentation of tumors and relevant structures within
  medical images, reducing the time and effort required for manual labeling.
- **Annotation Accuracy**: Ensure that auto-segmentation tools produce precise
  and clinically relevant boundaries, enhancing the quality of downstream AI
  applications.
- **Model Validation**: Implement rigorous validation processes to assess the
  reliability and accuracy of segmentation models, making them suitable for
  clinical and research applications.

## Treatment Planning and Monitoring

- **AI-driven Planning**: Enable AI models trained on Med-ImageNet data to
  support personalized treatment planning by identifying key anatomical
  features and potential risks.
- **Patient Monitoring**: Leverage imaging data to monitor treatment progress
  and detect early signs of relapse or treatment response, enabling timely
  interventions.
- **Outcome Prediction**: Develop models that use imaging features to predict
  patient outcomes, supporting oncologists in making data-driven treatment
  decisions.

## Open ML Challenge for Head and Neck Cancer

- **Challenge Objective**: Host a public machine learning challenge focused on
  head and neck cancer segmentation and analysis to encourage innovation and
  improve model accuracy.
- **Data Access and Submission**: Provide participants with access to
  anonymized Med-ImageNet data for training and testing, with submissions
  evaluated on segmentation accuracy and clinical relevance.
- **Advancing Model Generalizability**: Use the challenge to identify models
  that generalize well across diverse data, with high potential for clinical
  implementation.
