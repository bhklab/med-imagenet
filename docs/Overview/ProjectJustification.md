# Project Justification

!!! abstract "Abstract"
    Med-ImageNet addresses a major gap: a standardized framework for
    accessible, large-scale imaging datasets specifically for AI in oncology.

    Existing imaging datasets are fragmented, varying widely in quality, format,
    and annotation, which complicates AI model training and reliability.

## Current Gaps in Medical Imaging Data

- **Data Silos:** Medical imaging data is often siloed within institutions,
  limiting external access.

- **Annotation Issues:** Datasets lack detailed annotation required
  for advanced AI tasks like auto-segmentation and treatment planning.

- **Curation and Accessibility:** Inadequate curation and
  accessibility hinder the application of machine learning for accurate cancer
  diagnosis and treatment.

## Need for Standardization in AI Research

- **Consistency Across Datasets:** Standardization is essential for
  ensuring that AI models can perform reliably across diverse datasets. Without
  consistent data, models risk overfitting to specific datasets, limiting their
  broader applicability.

- **Global Collaboration:** A standardized framework
  allows researchers worldwide to access uniform data, enhancing collaboration
  and accelerating advancements in cancer treatment and AI development.

## Impact on Cancer Research and Treatment

- **Enhanced Predictive Power:** Access to a large,
  standardized dataset boosts the predictive accuracy of AI models, helping
  clinicians make better-informed treatment decisions.

- **Improved Patient Outcomes:** With more reliable AI models,
  treatment planning can be personalized, leading to better outcomes and more
  efficient resource allocation in oncology care.
