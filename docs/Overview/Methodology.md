# Methodology

## Data Collection and Curation Process

- **Source Identification**: Identify and collect diverse imaging data from
  trusted sources, ensuring a broad representation of cancer types and
  demographic groups.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Implement rigorous data cleaning to
  remove inconsistencies and prepare images for standardized processing.
- **Annotation Standards**: Apply consistent annotation protocols across all
  datasets, with expert validation to ensure quality and reliability.

## MedImage-Tools Development

- **Tool Design**: Develop tools that streamline the standardization process,
  allowing researchers to easily convert raw imaging data into a format
  compatible with Med-ImageNet standards.
- **Automation and Scalability**: Design MedImage-Tools with automation
  capabilities to handle large-scale data efficiently, ensuring the dataset
  remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

## Integration of FAIR Principles

- **Findability**: Ensure that all dataset components are tagged and indexed
  for easy discoverability within the research community.
- **Accessibility**: Provide an open-access platform where researchers can
  securely access and download data for AI model training and validation.
- **Interoperability**: Structure data in widely accepted formats, facilitating
  cross-platform compatibility and collaboration.
- **Reusability**: Design data with future adaptability in mind, enabling its
  application across a variety of oncology research initiatives.
