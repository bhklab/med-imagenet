# Research Objectives and Aims

## Primary Goal

Develop an open-access, standardized medical imaging dataset specifically
curated for cancer research and AI applications in oncology.

## Specific Objectives

1. **Data Curation and Annotation**:

    Establish robust pipelines for data
    collection, curation, and high-quality annotation to support machine learning
    tasks in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

1. **Med-ImageTools Development**:

    Create a suite of tools to streamline data
    standardization, facilitating widespread adoption and usability of the
    Med-ImageNet dataset.

1. **AI Model Support**:

    Enable training and validation of AI models for
    applications like tumor segmentation, treatment planning, and outcome
    prediction.

## Long-term Vision

Establish Med-ImageNet as the gold standard resource for AI-driven cancer
research, encouraging global collaboration and advancing personalized oncology
care.
