# Evaluation and Validation Framework for AI Models

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of AI models trained on Med-ImageNet, a
rigorous evaluation and validation framework is implemented:

- **Benchmark Datasets**: Provides standardized benchmark datasets within
  Med-ImageNet to evaluate model performance across common metrics.
- **Cross-validation Protocols**: Supports cross-validation to verify model
  robustness and prevent overfitting, ensuring that models generalize well
  across different patient groups.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes metrics for evaluating segmentation
  accuracy, predictive power, and clinical relevance of AI models.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: Allows experts to review and validate AI
  model outputs, ensuring that predictions are clinically meaningful.
- **Continuous Model Improvement**: Framework supports ongoing model
  evaluation, with feedback loops to integrate new data and improve
  performance over time.
