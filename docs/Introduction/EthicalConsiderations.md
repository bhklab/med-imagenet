# Ethical Considerations in AI-driven Cancer Research

Developing AI models for cancer research introduces important ethical
considerations:

- **Bias in Data Representation**: Ensuring diverse representation in the dataset
  is essential to prevent AI models from inheriting biases that could impact
  underrepresented groups.
- **Transparency and Explainability**: AI models should be transparent and
  interpretable, allowing clinicians to understand the basis of AI-driven
  recommendations.
- **Informed Consent**: Patientsâ€™ consent for the use of their medical images
  in research must be clearly defined, especially when sharing data across
  institutions.
- **Accountability in Decision-Making**: AI models used in clinical settings must
  have clear accountability guidelines to manage potential errors and adverse
  outcomes.
- **Equitable Access to AI Innovations**: The benefits of AI-driven advancements
  should be accessible across various healthcare settings, including those
  with limited resources.
