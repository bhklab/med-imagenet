# Challenges in Medical Imaging Standardization

Standardizing medical imaging data for AI applications presents several
challenges:

- **Variability in Imaging Modalities**: Different imaging techniques (e.g., MRI,
  CT, PET) produce data with distinct characteristics, making uniform
  standardization difficult.
- **Inconsistent Metadata**: Metadata formats vary across institutions and
  devices, complicating the integration of diverse datasets.
- **Resolution and Quality Differences**: Variations in image resolution and
  quality across sources can affect model training, as AI models are sensitive
  to inconsistencies in input data.
- **Interoperability Issues**: Lack of standardized file formats and data
  structures hinders interoperability between platforms and research tools.
- **Data Annotation Challenges**: Ensuring consistency in annotation across
  large datasets is resource-intensive, requiring expert input and validation.
