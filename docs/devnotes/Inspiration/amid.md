# neuro-ml/amid (Awesome Medical Imaging Datasets)

Github repository: [neuro-ml/amid](https://github.com/neuro-ml/amid)

Really interesting way they have set up a easy-to-use interface for loading
datasets.

Pros:

- similar user API for each dataset
- very nice code organization
- neat code quality

Cons:

- Manually created code for each dataset
- Not very scalable
- Requires users to download and organize the datasets themselves.
