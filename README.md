# Med-ImageNet: Open-source Medical Imaging Data Curation for Large-scale AI

<!--intro-start-->

## Project Description

Med-ImageNet is a transformative framework aiming to facilitate **access** to
**standardized** medical imaging dataset for cancer research and clinical AI applications.

## Key Information

- 🖼 **Project Title**: Med-ImageNet

- 🧬 **Objective**:  Standardize and curate oncology imaging data to
**support AI-driven cancer research,** focusing on **auto-segmentation**,
**treatment planning**, and **monitoring**.

- 🌐 **Significance**: Tackles the lack of standardized healthcare imaging data,
making data **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)**
for machine learning applications.

- 💻 **Innovations**: Develops MedImage-Tools for data standardization,
providing a comprehensive, open-source dataset for cancer imaging.

- 🌍 **Equity and Inclusion**: Prioritizes data inclusivity by
representing diverse populations in cancer research.

- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Engages with the AI and medical communities to
foster collaboration and innovation in cancer research.
